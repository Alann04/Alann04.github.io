        <h3>About Slime's Journey:</h3>
        <h4>Story</h4>
        <p>The game is about a slime that runs into a swarm of bees, and is<br>
        trying to dodge them as long as possible</p>
        <h4>Code</h4>
        <p>At first I wanted to implement a scoring system based on coins but<br>
        some dreams don't become reality, so I based my scoring on the time.<br>
        Every second, the player would obtain a point. The RNG that is implemented<br>
        in the game is used for the cloud positioning and the bee's positioning.<br>
        The difficulty will change every 15 seconds The player will lose when the<br> 
        bees touch the slime, there is no other way for the game to start.</p>
        <h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
        <p>My game was started with a single sprite, the bee. I really wanted one<br>
        of my sprites to be based on another character from another popular pixelated<br>
        series. The slime was implemented in the later stages because I needed a<br>
        character that is known to jump. When making the game, I was particularly<br>
        happy with coding the death circumstances for the slime, because that felt<br>
        like my first step towards real progress. Another point is the tutorial screen,<br>
        which features the bee showing off a grand dialogue. The biggest obstacle<br>
        was getting the collision for the bee and slime, and the slime and floor.<br>
        Each sprite messed with the others. Another issue was getting the bees to<br>
        create more bees that would do the same thing. However I did not add a crucial<br>
        component in the early stages, and a prominent glitch I called "the swarm"<br>
        would get me back into the blocks.<p>
        <h4>Future Ideas</h4>
        <p>The product, Slime's Journey, will need a lot more development before<br>
        I decide that it is ready, one element I want to add is for bees to come<br>
        from every edge of the screen to give the player a more difficult experience.<br>
        I would also add more duplicate clouds to make the task of dodging bees<br>
        easier for players, however, I am quite satisfied with the product so far</p>
        <h4>Favorite Script</h4>
        <p>My favorite script to code of the game was the cloning of the bee. I am<br>
        particularly proud of that piece of code because it took a while to perfect.<br>
        the more blocks were also extremely fun to work with as well.</p>
        <h4>Use of "more blocks":</h4>
